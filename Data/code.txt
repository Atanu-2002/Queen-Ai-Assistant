Hello! I'm here to help you with your content writing needs. Sure, I can write code for you. What kind of code would you like me to write? Here are a few examples of the types of code I can write:

* HTML/CSS code for a website
* Python code for a script or application
* JavaScript code for a web page or application
* SQL code for a database

Please let me know what you need, and I'll be happy to help.

Here is an example of a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```
And here is an example of an HTML page that displays a heading and a paragraph:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything specific you would like me to write. I'm here to help.
